	<h3>Questions</h3>
	<p>1. This API holds information about different holidays. <br><br>2. I found it at <a href="https://calendarific.com/">Calendarific</a> <br><br>3. I had to send in the year and the country that I was looking for a holiday in, but I also sent in the month of November as well as the date of the 1st. <br><br>4. This API is useful for determining wheter or not a given day is a holiday and when holidays fall during the year. This could be useful for creating a calendar for a website or determining whether or not a business should be open or providing services on a given day. </p>
